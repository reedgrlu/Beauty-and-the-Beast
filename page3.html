"My father is gravely ill and close to dying! Oh, how I wish I could see him again, before it's too late!" But the <span class="beast">Beast</span> only shook its head.</p>

<p>"No! You will never leave this castle!" And off it stalked in a rage. However, a little later, it returned and spoke solemnly to the girl.</p>

<p>"If you swear that you will return here in seven days time, I'll let you go and visit your father!" <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> threw herself at the <span class="beast">Beast</span>'s feet in delight.</p>

<p>"I swear! I swear I will! How kind you are! You've made a loving daughter so happy!" In reality, the <span class="merchant">Merchant</span> had fallen ill from a broken heart at knowing his daughter was being kept prisoner. When he embraced her again, he was soon on the road to recovery. <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> stayed beside him for hours on end, describing her life at the Castle, and explaining that the <span class="beast">Beast</span> was really good and kind. The days flashed past, and at last the <span class="merchant">Merchant</span> was able to leave his bed. He was completely well again. <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> was happy at last. However, she had failed to notice that seven days had gone by.</p>

<p>Then one night she woke from a terrible nightmare. She had dreamt that the <span class="beast">Beast</span> was dying and calling for her, twisting in agony.</p>

<p>"Come back! Come back to me!" it was pleading. The solemn promise she had made drove her to leave home immediately.</p>

<p>"Hurry! Hurry, good horse!" she said, whipping her steed onwards towards the castle, afraid that she might arrive too late. She rushed up the stairs, calling, but there was no reply. Her heart in her mouth, <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> ran into the garden and there crouched the <span class="beast">Beast</span>, its eyes shut, as though dead. <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> threw herself at it and hugged it tightly.</p>

<p>"Don't die! Don't die! I'll marry you . . ." At these words, a miracle took place. The <span class="beast">Beast</span>'s ugly snout turned magically into the face of a handsome young man.</p>

<p>"How I've been longing for this moment!" he said. "I was suffering in silence, and couldn't tell my frightful secret. An evil witch turned me into a monster and only the love of a maiden willing to accept me as I was, could transform me back into my real self. My dearest! I'll be so happy if you'll marry me."</p>

<p>The wedding took place shortly after and, from that day on, the young Prince would have nothing but roses in his gardens. And that's why, to this day, the castle is known as the Castle of the Rose.
