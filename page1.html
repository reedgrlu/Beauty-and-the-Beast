<a id="O">O</a>nce upon a time as a <span class="merchant">Merchant</span> set off for market, he asked each of his three daughters what she would like as a present on his return. The first daughter wanted a brocade dress, the second a pearl necklace, but the third, whose name was <span class="beauty">Beauty</span>, the youngest, prettiest and sweetest of them all, said to her father:

<p>"All I'd like is a rose you've picked specially for me!"</p>

<p>When the <span class="merchant">Merchant</span> had finished his business, he set off for home. However, a sudden storm blew up, and his horse could hardly make headway in the howling gale. Cold and weary, the <span class="merchant">Merchant</span> had lost all hope of reaching an inn when he suddenly noticed a bright light shining in the middle of a wood. As he drew near, he saw that it was a castle, bathed in light.</p>


<p>"I hope I'll find shelter there for the night," he said to himself. When he reached the door, he saw it was open, but though he shouted, nobody came to greet him. Plucking up courage, he went inside, still calling out to attract attention. On a table in the main hall, a splendid dinner lay already served. The <span class="merchant">Merchant</span> lingered, still shouting for the owner of the castle. But no one came, and so the starving <span class="merchant">Merchant</span> sat down to a hearty meal.</p>

<p>Overcome by curiosity, he ventured upstairs, where the corridor led into magnificent rooms and halls. A fire crackled in the first room and a soft bed looked very inviting. It was now late, and the <span class="merchant">Merchant</span> could not resist. He lay down on the bed and fell fast asleep. When he woke next morning, an unknown hand had placed a mug of steaming coffee and some fruit by his bedside.</p>

<p>The <span class="merchant">Merchant</span> had breakfast and after tidying himself up, went downstairs to thank his generous host. But, as on the evening before, there was nobody in sight. Shaking his head in wonder at the strangeness of it all, he went towards the garden where he had left his horse, tethered to a tree. Suddenly, a large rose bush caught his eye.</p>

<p>Remembering his promise to <span class="beauty">Beauty</span>, he bent down to pick a rose. Instantly, out of the rose garden, sprang a horrible <span class="beast">Beast</span>, wearing splendid clothes. Two bloodshot eyes, gleaming angrily, glared at him and a deep, terrifying voice growled: "Ungrateful man! I gave you shelter, you ate at my table and slept in my own bed, but now all the thanks I get is the theft of my favorite flowers! I shall put you to death for this slight!" Trembling with fear, the <span class="merchant">Merchant</span> fell on his knees before the <span class="beast">Beast</span>.</p>

<p>"Forgive me! Forgive me! Don't kill me! I'll do anything you say! The rose wasn't for me, it was for my daughter <span class="beauty">Beauty</span>. I promised to bring her back a rose from my journey!" The <span class="beast">Beast</span> dropped the paw it had clamped on the unhappy <span class="merchant">Merchant</span>.</p>

"I shall spare your life, but on one condition, that you bring me your daughter!" The terror-stricken <span class="merchant">Merchant</span>, faced with certain death if he did not obey, promised that he would do so. When he reached home in tears, his three daughters ran to greet him. After he had told them of his dreadful adventure, <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> put his mind at rest immediately.</p>	
	
<p>"Dear father, I'd do anything for you! Don't worry, you'll be able to keep your promise and save your life! Take me to the castle. I'll stay there in your place!" The <span class="merchant">Merchant</span> hugged his daughter.</p>
	
<p>"I never did doubt your love for me. For the moment I can only thank you for saving my life." So <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> was led to the castle. The <span class="beast">Beast</span>, however, had quite an unexpected greeting for the girl. Instead of menacing doom as it had done with her father, it was surprisingly pleasant.</p>

<p>In the beginning, <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> was frightened of the <span class="beast">Beast</span>, and shuddered at the sight of it. Then she found that, in spite of the monster's awful head, her horror of it was gradually fading as time went by. She had one of the finest rooms in the Castle, and sat for hours, embroidering in front of the fire. And the <span class="beast">Beast</span> would sit, for hours on end, only a short distance away, silently gazing at her. Then it started to say a few kind words, till in the end, <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> was amazed to discover that she was actually enjoying its conversation. The days passed, and <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> and the <span class="beast">Beast</span> became good friends. Then one day, the <span class="beast">Beast</span> asked the girl to be his wife.</p>

<p>Taken by surprise, <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> did not know what to say. Marry such an ugly monster? She would rather die! But she did not want to hurt the feelings of one who, after all, had been kind to her. And she remembered too that she owed it her own life as well as her father's.</p>

<p>"I really can't say yes," she began shakily. "I'd so much like to..." The <span class="beast">Beast</span> interrupted her with an abrupt gesture.</p>

<p>"I quite understand! And I'm not offended by your refusal!" Life went on as usual, and nothing further was said. One day, the <span class="beast">Beast</span> presented <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> with a magnificent magic mirror. When <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> peeped into it, she could see her family, far away.</p>

<p>"You won't feel so lonely now," were the words that accompanied the gift. <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> stared for hours at her distant family. Then she began to feel worried. One day, the <span class="beast">Beast</span> found her weeping beside the magic mirror.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" he asked, kindly as always.</p>

"My father is gravely ill and close to dying! Oh, how I wish I could see him again, before it's too late!" But the <span class="beast">Beast</span> only shook its head.</p>

<p>"No! You will never leave this castle!" And off it stalked in a rage. However, a little later, it returned and spoke solemnly to the girl.</p>

<p>"If you swear that you will return here in seven days time, I'll let you go and visit your father!" <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> threw herself at the <span class="beast">Beast</span>'s feet in delight.</p>

<p>"I swear! I swear I will! How kind you are! You've made a loving daughter so happy!" In reality, the <span class="merchant">Merchant</span> had fallen ill from a broken heart at knowing his daughter was being kept prisoner. When he embraced her again, he was soon on the road to recovery. <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> stayed beside him for hours on end, describing her life at the Castle, and explaining that the <span class="beast">Beast</span> was really good and kind. The days flashed past, and at last the <span class="merchant">Merchant</span> was able to leave his bed. He was completely well again. <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> was happy at last. However, she had failed to notice that seven days had gone by.</p>

<p>Then one night she woke from a terrible nightmare. She had dreamt that the <span class="beast">Beast</span> was dying and calling for her, twisting in agony.</p>

<p>"Come back! Come back to me!" it was pleading. The solemn promise she had made drove her to leave home immediately.</p>

<p>"Hurry! Hurry, good horse!" she said, whipping her steed onwards towards the castle, afraid that she might arrive too late. She rushed up the stairs, calling, but there was no reply. Her heart in her mouth, <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> ran into the garden and there crouched the <span class="beast">Beast</span>, its eyes shut, as though dead. <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> threw herself at it and hugged it tightly.</p>

<p>"Don't die! Don't die! I'll marry you . . ." At these words, a miracle took place. The <span class="beast">Beast</span>'s ugly snout turned magically into the face of a handsome young man.</p>

<p>"How I've been longing for this moment!" he said. "I was suffering in silence, and couldn't tell my frightful secret. An evil witch turned me into a monster and only the love of a maiden willing to accept me as I was, could transform me back into my real self. My dearest! I'll be so happy if you'll marry me."</p>

<p>The wedding took place shortly after and, from that day on, the young Prince would have nothing but roses in his gardens. And that's why, to this day, the castle is known as the Castle of the Rose.
