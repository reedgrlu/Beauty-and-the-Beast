"I shall spare your life, but on one condition, that you bring me your daughter!" The terror-stricken <span class="merchant">Merchant</span>, faced with certain death if he did not obey, promised that he would do so. When he reached home in tears, his three daughters ran to greet him. After he had told them of his dreadful adventure, <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> put his mind at rest immediately.</p>	
	
<p>"Dear father, I'd do anything for you! Don't worry, you'll be able to keep your promise and save your life! Take me to the castle. I'll stay there in your place!" The <span class="merchant">Merchant</span> hugged his daughter.</p>
	
<p>"I never did doubt your love for me. For the moment I can only thank you for saving my life." So <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> was led to the castle. The <span class="beast">Beast</span>, however, had quite an unexpected greeting for the girl. Instead of menacing doom as it had done with her father, it was surprisingly pleasant.</p>

<p>In the beginning, <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> was frightened of the <span class="beast">Beast</span>, and shuddered at the sight of it. Then she found that, in spite of the monster's awful head, her horror of it was gradually fading as time went by. She had one of the finest rooms in the Castle, and sat for hours, embroidering in front of the fire. And the <span class="beast">Beast</span> would sit, for hours on end, only a short distance away, silently gazing at her. Then it started to say a few kind words, till in the end, <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> was amazed to discover that she was actually enjoying its conversation. The days passed, and <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> and the <span class="beast">Beast</span> became good friends. Then one day, the <span class="beast">Beast</span> asked the girl to be his wife.</p>

<p>Taken by surprise, <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> did not know what to say. Marry such an ugly monster? She would rather die! But she did not want to hurt the feelings of one who, after all, had been kind to her. And she remembered too that she owed it her own life as well as her father's.</p>

<p>"I really can't say yes," she began shakily. "I'd so much like to..." The <span class="beast">Beast</span> interrupted her with an abrupt gesture.</p>

<p>"I quite understand! And I'm not offended by your refusal!" Life went on as usual, and nothing further was said. One day, the <span class="beast">Beast</span> presented <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> with a magnificent magic mirror. When <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> peeped into it, she could see her family, far away.</p>

<p>"You won't feel so lonely now," were the words that accompanied the gift. <span class="beauty">Beauty</span> stared for hours at her distant family. Then she began to feel worried. One day, the <span class="beast">Beast</span> found her weeping beside the magic mirror.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" he asked, kindly as always.</p>
